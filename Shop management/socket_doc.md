## what is socket?

A socket is a communication endpoint that allows different processes to communicate with each other on a network.


## why do we use socket?

Sockets are used in networking to establish a connection between two processes running on different devices, 
enabling data exchange and communication over a network.


## Advantages of socket:

- Versatility: Sockets can be used for various types of communication protocols.
- Flexibility: Sockets provide a flexible way to establish connections and exchange data.
- Efficiency: Sockets offer efficient data transfer mechanisms, suitable for real-time applications.


## disadvantages of socket:

- Complexity: Implementing socket communication can be complex, especially for beginners.
- Security: Sockets can be vulnerable to security threats if not properly implemented and secured.
- Platform Dependency: Sockets may have platform-specific implementations, leading to compatibility issues.


## summery about socket:

Summary of sockets: Sockets play a crucial role in enabling communication between processes over a network. They offer
versatility, flexibility, and efficiency in data exchange, but they can also be complex to implement and may pose
security risks if not handled carefully.
