## What is Threading?

Threading is a programming technique that allows multiple threads to execute concurrently within a single process. 
Threads are lightweight processes that share the same memory space and can run independently.


## Why do we use Threading?

Threading is used to improve the performance and responsiveness of applications by enabling them to execute multiple 
tasks simultaneously. It helps in utilizing the available resources efficiently and handling concurrent operations 
effectively.


## Advantages of Threading:

- Concurrency: Threading enables concurrent execution of tasks, making programs more responsive and efficient.
- Resource Utilization: Threads can utilize multiple CPU cores, maximizing the utilization of system resources.
- Improved Performance: By parallelizing tasks, threading can enhance the overall performance of applications.


## Disadvantages of Threading:

- Complexity: Managing threads introduces complexity in programming, including issues like race conditions and deadlocks.
- Resource Contentions: Threads competing for shared resources can lead to contention issues, impacting performance.
- Debugging Challenges: Debugging threaded programs can be challenging due to non-deterministic behavior and potential 
synchronization problems.


## Summary about Threading:

Threading is a powerful technique in programming that allows for concurrent execution of tasks within a single process. 
It offers advantages such as improved performance, resource utilization, and concurrency. However, threading also comes 
with challenges like complexity, resource contentions, and debugging difficulties that need to be carefully managed to
harness its benefits effectively.
