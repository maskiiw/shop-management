## What is Traceback?

Traceback is a report that shows the sequence of function calls that led to an error or exception in a program. 
It provides information about where the error occurred in the code.


## Why do we use Traceback?

Tracebacks are used to debug and troubleshoot programs by identifying the root cause of errors. They help developers 
understand the flow of execution leading up to an issue, making it easier to fix bugs.


## Advantages of Traceback:

- Error Localization: Tracebacks pinpoint the exact location of errors in the code, saving time in debugging.
- Debugging Aid: They provide a clear path of function calls, aiding developers in understanding the program flow.
- Improves Code Quality: By identifying errors quickly, tracebacks help in improving the overall quality of the codebase.


## Disadvantages of Traceback:

- Information Overload: Tracebacks can sometimes be overwhelming with a lot of technical details, 
making it challenging for beginners to interpret.
- Security Concerns: Detailed tracebacks may expose sensitive information about the code structure, 
posing security risks if not handled properly. 


## Summary about Traceback:

Traceback is a valuable tool in software development for diagnosing and fixing errors. It provides a detailed account of
function calls leading to an exception, helping developers efficiently troubleshoot issues and enhance code quality.
While tracebacks offer significant advantages in debugging, they should be handled carefully to avoid potential security
vulnerabilities.
